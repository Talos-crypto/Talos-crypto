Cloud-backed applications allow users to access their data from multiple devices and allow applications to
work with large amounts of data that could not otherwise be computed over due to
performance and storage limitations on mobile devices.

A common example of such applications are Health and Fitness Tracking Applications.
While they collect data that is not inherently sensitive at first glance there are in fact sophisticated machine learning and correlation tools that allow inferring highly sensitive information from activity tracking data.

With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) the number of sensors and devices that monitor us and our surroundings is increasing rapidly. Due to the size and power constraints inherent in IoT applications many systems rely on a cloud backend to provide aggregation, analysis and insights. Especially in the case of consumer-oriented applications this usually requires the user to hand control over their data to the company offering the cloud services.
