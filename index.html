### Background
Cloud-backed applications allow users to access their data from multiple devices and allow applications to
work with large amounts of data that could not otherwise be computed over due to
performance and storage limitations on mobile devices.

A common example of such applications are Health and Fitness Tracking Applications.
While they collect data that is not inherently sensitive at first glance there are in fact sophisticated machine learning and correlation tools that allow inferring highly sensitive information from activity tracking data.

With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) the number of sensors and devices that monitor us and our surroundings is increasing rapidly. Due to the size and power constraints inherent in IoT applications many systems rely on a cloud backend to provide aggregation, analysis and insights. Especially in the case of consumer-oriented applications this usually requires the user to hand control over their data to the company offering the cloud services.

### Encrypted Data Processing
In order to enable users to regain control over their data and therefore privacy, Shafagh et al. developed Talos, a cryptographic tool-set to enable encrypted query processing for mobile devices and embedded Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is based on the idea of combining Partial Homomorphic Encryption and Property Preserving Encryption, first introduced in [CryptDB](https://css.csail.mit.edu/cryptdb/). A remote (e.g. cloud-hosted) Database is used to store encrypted values. Thanks to the properties of the mentioned encryption schemes we can still execute many SQL queries over the data while giving up only small amounts of information about the plaintext data.

### The Smartphone as a Gateway
Many consumer-oriented IoT devices (e.g. fitness trackers) currently use smartphones as a gateway to both the user and to the cloud. Smartphone applications can be used to interact with and configure devices while the smartphones network connectivity can be used to establish a connection to the cloud. [Talos for Android](https://github.com/Talos-crypto/Talos-Android) is a ready-to-use framework that allows application developers to easily add encrypted data processing to their applications. Documentation and sample applications can be found in the [project repo](https://github.com/Talos-crypto/Talos-Android).

### Embedded Devices
While many consumer devices use a smartphone as a gateway there are many embedded devices that do not require gateways.
Especially in an industrial setting, many IoT devices can directly connect to the network (i.e. embedded devices with IP capabilities). A proof-of-concept implementation of the Talos Framework for the OpenMote Platform/Contiki OS can be seen [here](https://github.com/Talos-crypto/Talos-Contiki).
