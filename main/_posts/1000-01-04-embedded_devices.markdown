While many consumer devices use a smartphone as a gateway there are many embedded devices that do not require gateways.
Especially in an industrial setting, many IoT devices can directly connect to the network (i.e. embedded devices with IP capabilities). A proof-of-concept implementation of the Talos Framework for the OpenMote Platform/Contiki OS can be seen [here](https://github.com/Talos-crypto/Talos-Contiki).
