---

Many consumer-oriented IoT devices (e.g. fitness trackers) currently use smartphones as a gateway to both the user and to the cloud. Smartphone applications can be used to interact with and configure devices while the smartphones network connectivity can be used to establish a connection to the cloud. [Talos for Android](https://github.com/Talos-crypto/Talos-Android) is a ready-to-use framework that allows application developers to easily add encrypted data processing to their applications. Documentation and sample applications can be found in the [project repo](https://github.com/Talos-crypto/Talos-Android).x
